/**
 * Problem 56: Powerful digit sum
 *
 * A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
 * 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
 * Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
 *
 * Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a, b < 100, what is the
 * maximum digital sum?
