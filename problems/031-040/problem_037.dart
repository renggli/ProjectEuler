/**
 * Problem 37: Truncatable primes
 *
 * The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is
 * possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime
 * at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to
 * left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.
 *
 * Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left
 * to right and right to left.
 *
 * NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.
